# bitpulsed Project

Welcome to the bitpulsed project! bitpulsed is a fork of Bitcoin, aimed at expanding the accessibility and availability of digital currency by introducing a "secondary" supply to complement the existing Bitcoin ecosystem. Our unique proposition lies in addressing the challenges posed by the finite supply of Bitcoin, making digital currency more accessible to a broader audience.

## Relationship with Bitcoin

bitpulsed builds upon the robust foundation of Bitcoin. Our goal is to introduce a supplementary digital currency that coexists with Bitcoin, enhancing the overall cryptocurrency market's liquidity and stability. By doing so, we aim to preserve the core functionality and integrity of the original Bitcoin protocol while making digital currency more attainable.

### Why We Reference Bitcoin Resources

- **Relevance and Integrity**: bitpulsed directly inherits many aspects from Bitcoin, making the original documentation, development discussions, and resources extremely relevant to our project.
  
- **Transparency**: It's our belief that providing users with complete context about bitpulsed's foundation is crucial. This includes direct references to Bitcoin's resources to ensure a clear understanding of our roots and intentions.

- **Education and Knowledge Sharing**: The extensive documentation and community discussions surrounding Bitcoin serve as invaluable resources for understanding the principles underpinning bitpulsed. We encourage our community to delve into these materials for a deeper grasp of the technology driving our development.

### Understanding the Differences

While bitpulsed and Bitcoin share a common heritage, bitpulsed introduces specific changes and enhancements, including:

- **Secondary Supply**: Introduction of a secondary supply mechanism aimed at complementing Bitcoin's fixed supply, addressing the market's demand for a more accessible digital currency.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Efforts to make digital currency more accessible to a wider audience, potentially including simplified mining processes or altered consensus mechanisms to reduce entry barriers.
- **Community-Driven Development**: A focus on community-driven features and improvements that cater to the needs of bitpulsed users, informed by open discussions and feedback.

For a detailed overview of the differences and customizations specific to bitpulsed, we encourage you to explore the existing Bitcoin documentation and resources, as many foundational concepts and mechanisms remain unchanged.
